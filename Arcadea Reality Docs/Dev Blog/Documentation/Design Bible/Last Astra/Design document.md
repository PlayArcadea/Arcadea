His story is about a girl who's environment is completely turned upside down, is altered by her dreams and mental state as she struggles through the unknown complexity that surrounds her. How does this impact the world and reaching her goals? Real world challenges test her limits and she is unable to press on, giving up entirely on living a normal life. She is trapped in limbo. Collapsing, hopeless into the abyss of misfortune.

Drifting as if the simple passage of time has no meaning, alone in the park, walking the path of least resistance, amongst the trees shedding colored leaves as autumn approaches.

Upon hearing the crackling of thunder beneath my feet, the world turns upside-down.

I felt my hair stand up, the feeling of falling sweeps through me like a jolt of electricity.

But I wasn't falling down. I am falling up.

I was a fruit looking for the grass beneath my feet, thrashing, confused, but only an endless empty sky curled around above where I was just rooted by gravity in the park, by the bench on the ground lit by a flickering lamp light, I wondered deeply what was happening to me, was it real or am I dreaming? A cloud hangs over me. My feet dangling towards the moon, feeling it's pull.

The cold moisture in the air trickled under my clothes and I shivered.

One moment, two, fifteen, twenty-five, the distance between me and the planet grew further and eventually more alien.

My given name is Rena.

My new name is

Astra--The Last Astra. A new leaf.

This body given to me is completely magical.
